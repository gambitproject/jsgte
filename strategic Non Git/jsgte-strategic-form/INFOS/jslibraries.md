JavaScript is missing stuff (and it's weird)
 For those who don't know: standard JavaScript defines a very
 minimal set of basic library routines or functions. The
 glaringly obvious omission of being able to iterate with a
 forEach led that feature to be reinvented countless
 times...with different syntax.

# backbone.js

http://backbonejs.org/

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by
 providing models with key-value binding and custom events,
 collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views
 with declarative event handling, and connects it all to
 your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

The project is hosted on GitHub, and the annotated source
 code is available, as well as an online test suite, an
 example application, a list of tutorials and a long list of
 real-world projects that use Backbone.

useful: storage of data on the CLIENT

If you’re writing an application where much of the heavy
lifting for view rendering and data manipulation will be
occurring in the browser, you may find a JavaScript MV*
framework useful. Examples of applications that fall into
this category are GMail, NewsBlur and the LinkedIn mobile
app.

These types of applications typically download a single
payload containing all the scripts, stylesheets, and markup
users need for common tasks and then perform a lot of
additional behavior in the background. For instance, it’s
trivial to switch between reading an email or document to
writing one without sending a new page request to the
server.
