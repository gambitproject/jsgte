Joined Slack for communication on Sat 30 April 2016.

Firefox "instant notifications" refer me to 
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/push-notifications-firefox?as=u&utm_source=inproduct

where certain privileges given to slack can be removed.
Just recorded here to know how to undo this if needed
(should not be necessary but I prefer to be safe).
